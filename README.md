# ImageEditor

This is my 2017 university group projec made with [Cyril Nb].

This application was made to combine our knowledge of Android development with image processing.

This app uses both OpenCV and RenderScript to increase processing speed of the different algorithms.
## Documentation
You can check the documentation here: https://cyrilnb.github.io/ImageEditor/

## Algorithms
### Basics
- Brightness and contrast edition
- Greyscale/Sepia/Negative effect
- Histogram equalisation
- Hue color change
- Greyscale everything except a picked color
- Sketch filter

### Convolution
Using OpenCV and RenderScript
- Gaussian blur with different intensities
- Mean blur 
- Laplacian filter
- Sobel filter

### Incrustation
Using OpenCV
- Eye incrustation
- Mouth incrustation
- Nose incrustation
